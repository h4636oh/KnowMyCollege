# KnowMyCollege

## About The Project

We have established this website with the aim of assisting students who have recently passed their common college entrance exams and find themselves in a state of confusion regarding which college to enroll in. Having been in the same position as you, having successfully cleared our exams, we understand your predicament better than anyone else. We offer a comprehensive form that is filled with choices related to various aspects of college selection. Based on the information provided in this form, we present you with tabulated data to help you make an informed decision. Additionally, we provide access to our chatbot, which is designed to address any queries or concerns you may have regarding your choices. Our goal is to simplify the college selection process and provide you with the support you need to embark on this new chapter of your academic journey with confidence.
